// CoalesceLatestPublisher and CoalesceLatestInner are one operator: the

// intentionally lives in this single file.

// MARK: - Leading-edge coalescing

extension Publisher where Failure == Never {
    /// Coalesces bursts while keeping the leading edge synchronous.
    ///
    /// Combine's `throttle` schedules every emission, including the first,
    /// onto the scheduler, so even an isolated value is deferred to the next
    /// run-loop turn and a subscriber never observes a synchronous emission.
    /// The sidebar's immediate observation contract requires the opposite:
    /// the current-state replay a subscriber receives from `@Published`
    /// upstreams, and the first change after an idle period, must both arrive
    /// in the same run-loop turn; only the tail of a burst may be deferred.
    ///
    /// Semantics per subscription:
    /// - The first value (the `@Published` replay of current state) is
    ///   forwarded synchronously and does not open a coalesce window, so a
    ///   change made right after subscribing is still synchronous.
    /// - A value arriving when no window is open is forwarded synchronously
    ///   and opens a window of `interval`.
    /// - Values arriving inside an open window are coalesced: the latest one
    ///   is emitted when the window closes (on `scheduler`), which opens the
    ///   next window.
    ///
    /// Downstream demand is honored: a value reaching an emission point while
    /// the downstream has zero outstanding demand is conflated into a
    /// latest-value slot and delivered from `request(_:)` when demand
    /// arrives. Demand-driven subscribers such as `AsyncPublisher`
    /// (`.values`) request one value at a time; forwarding past zero demand
    /// trips Combine's "received an unexpected value" trap, which crashes in
    /// every build configuration.
    ///
    /// Not thread-safe: intended for main-thread streams with `RunLoop.main`.
