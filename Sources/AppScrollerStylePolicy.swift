/// Forces overlay (auto-fading) scrollers across all of cmux's AppKit and
/// WKWebView scroll views by overriding a system-wide "Show scroll bars:
/// Always" (legacy) preference for cmux's process only.
///
/// In legacy-scroller environments — a mouse connected, or System Settings →
/// Appearance → Show scroll bars → Always (`defaults write -g
/// AppleShowScrollBars Always`) — macOS draws persistent, always-visible
/// scrollbars in every scroll view app-wide, including the page content of
/// `WKWebView`. That reserves a permanent bright track over browser panes and
/// other cmux chrome, which is the persistent-scrollbar symptom reported in
/// https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/3241.
///
/// AppKit resolves `NSScroller.preferredScrollerStyle` from the
/// `AppleShowScrollBars` default. Writing `WhenScrolling` into cmux's *own*
/// application defaults domain takes precedence over `NSGlobalDomain` for this
/// process only, so every cmux scroll view (the sidebar list, browser-pane web
/// content, settings panes, the file explorer) adopts the overlay style while
/// the user's system-wide preference is left untouched for every other app.
///
/// This is the same intent already applied surface-by-surface elsewhere
/// (terminals, the sidebar, text inputs all force `scrollerStyle = .overlay`);
/// this policy makes overlay the process default so AppKit-created scrollers
/// that cmux does not directly own — most importantly `WKWebView` page
/// scrollers — match instead of inheriting the legacy style.
///
/// It composes with `SidebarScrollViewConfigurator`: that type still forces
/// `.overlay` directly on the sidebar scroll view and tolerates no same-value
/// rewrites; this policy only changes the *default* AppKit reads when it
/// creates a scroller, so the two never fight. To avoid a redundant
/// app-domain write (which posts `UserDefaults.didChangeNotification` and can
/// nudge AppKit to re-evaluate scroller style mid-fade), the override is
/// written only when the resolved value is not already `WhenScrolling`.
///
/// Caveat: because the registration domain ranks *below* `NSGlobalDomain`, a
/// non-persistent `register(defaults:)` cannot beat a user's `Always`
/// preference — the override must live in the persistent application domain.
/// That value therefore outlives this code: if this policy is ever removed or
/// replaced with a user-facing opt-out, that change must also delete the
/// `AppleShowScrollBars` key from cmux's application domain (e.g. a one-shot
/// `defaults.removeObject(forKey:)` migration) so stale installs stop forcing
/// overlay. Accessibility note: this overrides a deliberate system-wide
/// "Always" choice for cmux only; it intentionally matches the no-opt-out
/// overlay forcing the terminal/sidebar/text-input surfaces already apply.
