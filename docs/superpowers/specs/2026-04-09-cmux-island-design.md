# cmux Island — MVP design

**Issue:** manaflow-ai/cmux#2590 — Pluggable macOS Dynamic Island Overlay for cmux.
**Date:** 2026-04-09
**Status:** Design approved — pending implementation plan.
**Scope:** MVP only. Explicit non-goals enumerated in §7.

---

## 1. Problem

Users running multiple AI agents inside cmux need a lightweight, persistent surface that tells them *which specific agent session needs attention right now* and lets them jump to the corresponding workspace + terminal split in one click. Today, a user has to scan the sidebar, hunt through splits, and interpret free-form status entries. There is no at-a-glance view across workspaces.

The issue proposes a notch-anchored Dynamic Island style overlay. The MVP in this spec delivers the monitoring and jump half of that vision; approvals and bidirectional hook routing are explicit non-goals, designed to slot in cleanly as Phase 2 without reshaping any MVP code.

## 2. User story (MVP)

> As a cmux user running Claude Code in one workspace, Codex in another, and Copilot CLI in a third, I want a small overlay at the top of my main display that shows me how many agent sessions are active and what state each is in, so I can click the one I care about and jump directly to that terminal split without hunting through the sidebar.

## 3. Goals and non-goals

**Goals (MVP):**

1. Always-on-top, click-to-expand island overlay anchored under the notch on the main display.
2. Zero new user-facing CLI. Light up automatically for anyone whose agents already call `cmux set-status <agent_kind> <phase>` per `docs/notifications.md`.
3. Click a row → cmux comes to the front, the corresponding workspace is selected, the corresponding panel is focused.
4. Opt-in, off by default, enabled through Settings and mirrored in `~/.config/cmux/settings.json`.
5. Module lives in `Sources/Island/` with a narrow, well-defined `IslandStateProvider` seam so a future `cmuxIsland.app` companion target can be extracted mechanically.
6. Covered by unit tests that exercise the projection, sort, and routing logic — no source-shape tests, no plist tests, nothing that CLAUDE.md's test quality policy forbids.

**Non-goals (deliberately deferred):**

1. Pending permission / approval tracking and approve/deny buttons.
2. New `cmux session` CLI or any typed session-lifecycle protocol.
3. Bidirectional or blocking hook RPC where the island answers hook-side permission prompts.
4. A separate Xcode target / companion `.app`. The extraction seam is designed; extraction itself is Phase 3.
5. Multi-display support. MVP is main display only.
6. Mark-read or dismiss-notification action invoked from inside the island.
7. Auto-dismiss of idle rows. Idle sessions remain until their status entry is cleared.
8. Hover-to-expand (click only, simpler, safer under cmux's focus policy).
9. Configurable left/right placement of the collapsed content (hardcoded left; trivial flip later).
10. Sparklines, token counts, chat preview, or any content deeper than `(workspace title, panel title, agentKind, phase, elapsed, unread count)`.
11. Monitoring agent sessions that run **outside** cmux panels. The island is cmux-panel-scoped by definition — that is what makes the jump action meaningful. (Claude Island already covers the non-cmux case.)
12. Auto-installing hooks into `~/.claude/hooks` or similar. Users keep the existing `cmux set-status` integrations documented in `docs/notifications.md`.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Module layout

```
Sources/Island/
├── IslandStateProvider.swift    — protocol; the only interface the view observes
├── IslandStateStore.swift       — concrete provider; projects TabManager → IslandSession list
├── IslandSession.swift          — value type + supporting enums
├── IslandFocusSink.swift        — protocol the router calls to focus workspace/panel
├── IslandJumpRouter.swift       — translates row taps into focus calls
├── IslandWindowController.swift — NSWindowController owning the NotchPanel
├── NotchPanel.swift             — NSPanel subclass
├── NotchShape.swift             — SwiftUI Shape (port from claude-island)
└── IslandRootView.swift         — SwiftUI view for closed/expanded states
```

### 4.2 Decoupling seam

The SwiftUI view layer (`IslandRootView`, debug windows) depends **only** on `IslandStateProvider`. `IslandStateStore` is the concrete production implementation, which reads `TabManager` / `Workspace` / `TerminalNotificationStore`. Tests use `InMemoryIslandStateProvider`. A Phase 3 `SocketIslandStateProvider` that consumes a new `island.subscribe` socket command would be a drop-in replacement — **no view code changes**.

Write-back from the island is equally confined. `IslandJumpRouter` calls methods on `IslandFocusSink`. The production implementation wraps `TabManager` / `NSWindow`; tests use a spy.

No other cmux source file imports the Island module. Removing `Sources/Island/` removes the feature entirely with no leftover references.

### 4.3 Data flow (read-only projection)

```
Workspace.statusEntries  ─┐
TerminalNotificationStore ─┼─► IslandStateStore ─► @Published sessions ─► IslandRootView
Workspace.panels/titles  ─┘        (Combine,
                                   debounced
                                   0.05s)
```

Debounce avoids flapping when multiple status entries update in the same runloop turn (e.g. an agent hook that fires `set-status` and `notify` back to back).

### 4.4 Integration with AppDelegate

`AppDelegate` observes `@AppStorage("island.enabled")`:

- `enabled = true`, controller is `nil` → instantiate `IslandWindowController`, attach its `IslandStateStore` to the shared `TabManager`, `orderFront` only when `sessions` is non-empty.
- `enabled = false`, controller is non-`nil` → call `close()`, release the `NSPanel`, cancel all Combine subscriptions. After disabling, the process must hold zero Island-owned timers, observers, or windows.

Rapidly toggling the Setting must never produce a stuck panel or orphaned observer (covered by the debug menu's rapid toggle path during PR review).

## 5. Data model

### 5.1 Types

```swift
/// Known agent kinds the island monitors. A panel is an island session iff its
/// Workspace.statusEntries contains at least one entry whose key equals one of these.
enum IslandAgentKind: String, CaseIterable, Hashable, Sendable {
    case claudeCode = "claude_code"
    case codex      = "codex"
    case copilotCli = "copilot_cli"
    case openCode   = "opencode"
    case geminiCli  = "gemini_cli"
    case cursor     = "cursor"
    case amp        = "amp"
    case droid      = "droid"

    var displayName: String { … }   // "Claude Code", "Codex", …
    var color: NSColor      { … }   // stable brand color per kind
    var monogram: String    { … }   // single character for the 20pt chip
}

/// Normalized session phase. Derived from SidebarStatusEntry.value via a
/// case-insensitive lookup table. Unknown values fall into .unknown.
enum IslandSessionPhase: String, Hashable, Sendable {
    case running
    case idle
    case waiting
    case error
    case unknown

    static func from(rawValue: String) -> IslandSessionPhase
}

/// One row in the island. Immutable value; regenerated on every store tick.
struct IslandSession: Identifiable, Equatable, Sendable {
    let id: UUID                // stable: panelId
    let workspaceId: UUID
    let panelId: UUID
    let agentKind: IslandAgentKind
    let phase: IslandSessionPhase
    let workspaceTitle: String
    let panelTitle: String
    let lastActivity: Date      // from SidebarStatusEntry.timestamp
    let unreadCount: Int        // from TerminalNotificationStore filtered by panelId
    let rawStatusValue: String  // kept for tooltip + debug window
}

protocol IslandStateProvider: AnyObject {
    var sessions: AnyPublisher<[IslandSession], Never> { get }
}
```

### 5.2 Projection rules

Given a `Workspace`, for each `panelId` referenced in `workspace.panels`:

1. Collect all `statusEntries[key]` where `key ∈ IslandAgentKind.allCases.map(\.rawValue)`.
2. If the collection is empty, the panel contributes no session.
3. Otherwise pick the highest-priority entry (highest numeric `SidebarStatusEntry.priority` first, ties broken by most recent `timestamp`). In MVP, two concurrent agents in the same panel are not supported — the winner defines the session.
4. Map `entry.value` → `IslandSessionPhase.from(rawValue:)`.
5. Populate `workspaceTitle` from `workspace.customTitle ?? workspace.title`, `panelTitle` from `workspace.panelCustomTitles[panelId] ?? workspace.panelTitles[panelId]` with fallback to the panel's `displayTitle`.
6. Populate `unreadCount` from `TerminalNotificationStore` filtered by `panelId`.
7. Populate `lastActivity` from `entry.timestamp`.

Across all workspaces, flatten and sort:

```
sortKey(session) = (phaseRank, -lastActivity.timeIntervalSince1970)
phaseRank: running=0, waiting=1, error=2, idle=3, unknown=4
```

### 5.3 Phase normalization table

`IslandSessionPhase.from(rawValue:)` is a single static dictionary, case-insensitive, trimmed:

| Raw value (case-insensitive)                               | Normalized phase |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `running`, `running_tool`, `processing`, `starting`         | `.running`       |
| `idle`, `` (empty), `ready`                                 | `.idle`          |
| `waiting`, `waiting_for_input`, `needs_input`, `needsinput` | `.waiting`       |
| `error`, `failed`, `failure`                                | `.error`         |
| (anything else)                                             | `.unknown`       |

Adding a new synonym is a one-line change in the dictionary; no UI code changes.

### 5.4 Visibility predicate

```
visible = !sessions.isEmpty
```

No "always visible" mode. No auto-hide delay for idle rows. If an agent hook crashes and leaves a stale entry behind, the row will stay on the island until the user runs `cmux clear-status <agent_kind>`. Acceptable for MVP; revisit in Phase 2.

### 5.5 Aggregate indicator color

The collapsed pill shows a single dot. Its color is the highest-severity phase currently present:

| Any session phase is… | Dot color |
|------------------------|-----------|
| `.running`             | green     |
| `.waiting`             | yellow    |
| `.error`               | red       |
| only `.idle` or `.unknown` | gray  |

## 6. UI

### 6.1 Window: `NotchPanel`

`NSPanel` subclass, ported from `farouqaldori/claude-island`. Configuration:

```swift
styleMask                = [.borderless, .nonactivatingPanel]
isFloatingPanel          = true
becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded   = true
isOpaque                 = false
backgroundColor          = .clear
hasShadow                = false
isMovable                = false
collectionBehavior       = [.fullScreenAuxiliary, .stationary,
                            .canJoinAllSpaces, .ignoresCycle]
level                    = .mainMenu + 3
```

Positioned with `frame.origin.x = screen.frame.origin.x`, `frame.size.width = screen.frame.width`, `frame.size.height = 750`, `frame.origin.y = screen.frame.maxY - 750`. Only the inner `NotchShape` is painted; the rest of the panel is transparent.

`ignoresMouseEvents` is toggled based on open/closed status so that, when collapsed, clicks outside the hit region pass through to the menu bar and apps underneath.

Target screen is `NSScreen.screens.first(where: { $0.hasPhysicalNotch }) ?? NSScreen.main`.

### 6.2 Shape: `NotchShape`

Direct port of claude-island's `NotchShape.swift`. Single contiguous path with:

- Inward-curving quadratic top-left and top-right corners (`topCornerRadius`) — these disappear into the screen bezel on notch Macs, and read as rounded corners on non-notch Macs.
- Outward-curving quadratic bottom-left and bottom-right corners (`bottomCornerRadius`) — these form the visible "bottom" of the notch extension.

`animatableData` is an `AnimatablePair` of the two radii so the shape can interpolate during open/close.

Let `ext = max(28pt, leftContentWidth)`. The shape is always horizontally symmetric around the notch: `shapeWidth = notchWidth + 2 × ext`. The right side gets the same `ext` width as the left, empty.

| State  | Width                          | Height                      | Top radius | Bottom radius |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Closed | `notchWidth + 2 × ext`         | `notchHeight` (≈ 32pt)       | 6          | 14            |
| Opened | `560pt`                        | `64 + rowCount × 56`, cap 540| 19         | 24            |

Animations:

- Open: `spring(response: 0.42, dampingFraction: 0.8)`
- Close: `spring(response: 0.45, dampingFraction: 1.0)`
- Closed-state dot/count/color changes: `.smooth`

### 6.3 Closed layout

```
[ ● 3 ] [     NOTCH     ] [       ]
  ^^^                      ^^^^^^^^
  left extension           right mirror (empty, same width, symmetry only)
```

- Dot: 6pt filled circle, color per §5.5, optional 6pt soft glow.
- Count: `sessions.count`, SF Pro 11pt semibold, tabular numerals.
- Left content (dot + count) measured, padded to at least 28pt. Right mirror copies the same `ext` width per §6.2 so the shape stays symmetric around the notch.
- **Hit region is the left extension only.** The right mirror is dead space. The physical notch area is never drawn or hit-tested.

Click → `viewModel.open(reason: .click)` → expand.

### 6.4 Opened layout

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  cmux Island                     [·]   │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤

```

- Header: 22pt strip with localized title `island.header.title` ("cmux Island"). No close button; click-outside handles it.
- Row: 56pt tall, 8pt vertical spacing, 12pt internal padding.
- Leading chip: 20pt rounded square, `IslandAgentKind.color`, monogram in white bold.
- Line 1: `workspaceTitle · panelTitle`, head-tail truncated if wider than the row content area.
- Line 2: `agentKind.displayName · <elapsed>` in 11pt secondary text. Elapsed is derived from `lastActivity` and re-computed once per second while expanded, never while collapsed.
- Trailing: phase pill (`RUNNING` / `IDLE` / `WAITING` / `ERROR` / `UNKNOWN`) with a phase-specific background + foreground color, plus a `· N` unread badge when `unreadCount > 0`.
- Max visible rows without scrolling: 8. 9+ enables a vertical scroller inside the expanded panel; shape height caps at 540pt.

### 6.5 Interactions

| Trigger                                    | Effect                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Click collapsed pill                       | Expand (spring animation)                                       |
| Click row                                  | `IslandJumpRouter.jump(to: session)`, then collapse             |
| Click outside expanded panel               | Collapse                                                        |
| Press `Esc` while opened                   | Collapse                                                        |
| Session list changes while collapsed       | Pill updates in place (count + dot color); no auto-expand       |
| Session list becomes empty                 | `window.orderOut(nil)` and stop redraw timers                   |
| Session list becomes non-empty from empty  | `window.orderFront(nil)`, start in closed state                 |

No hover-to-expand in MVP.

### 6.6 Jump routing

`IslandJumpRouter.jump(to: session)` performs the following, in order, against `IslandFocusSink`:

1. `activateAppBringingToFront()` — this is the single place in the island code that is allowed to activate cmux. The call is an explicit user focus intent (the click), which satisfies the focus-intent exception in cmux's socket focus policy (CLAUDE.md §"Socket focus policy"). No other island code path activates the app.
2. `selectWorkspace(session.workspaceId)` — routes through the same code path that the existing `workspace.select` socket command uses.
3. `focusPanel(session.panelId)` — routes through the same code path that the existing `pane.focus` / `surface.focus` socket commands use.
4. `collapseIsland(reason: .jumped)`.

If any of steps 2 or 3 fail (workspace or panel no longer exists), the router logs a single `dlog("island.jump failed…")` in DEBUG builds and collapses the island without activating cmux. No error UI in MVP.

### 6.7 Non-notch Mac behavior

- `viewModel.hasPhysicalNotch` is used only to drive the initial fade-in opacity.
- The same `NotchShape` is drawn. With no physical cutout between the inward top corners, it reads as a floating dark pill centered at the top of the screen.
- All other behavior (projection, visibility, expand, collapse, routing) is identical.

## 7. Configuration and opt-in

### 7.1 Source of truth

`@AppStorage("island.enabled")` is the single source of truth.

Mirrored in `~/.config/cmux/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "island": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

`CmuxConfig.swift` gains an `IslandConfigSection` with one boolean. The existing `CmuxConfigExecutor` pipeline handles reload-on-change so that editing the file is equivalent to flipping the Settings toggle. Default value is `false`.

### 7.2 Settings UI

A new sidebar entry **"Island"** is added to the Settings window, positioned after "Notifications". Contents:

- Single toggle: **"Show agent session island overlay"** (key `island.settings.enable.label`).
- Descriptive help text under the toggle explaining what it does, when it appears, and which known-agent keys it looks at — localized strings only.

All strings live in `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` with English + Japanese per CLAUDE.md. Keys:

- `island.settings.title`
- `island.settings.enable.label`
- `island.settings.enable.help`
- `island.settings.known_kinds.help`
- `island.header.title`
- `island.phase.running`, `island.phase.idle`, `island.phase.waiting`, `island.phase.error`, `island.phase.unknown`
- `island.tooltip.raw_status` (debug-window row tooltip, DEBUG only)

### 7.3 Debug UI (DEBUG builds only)

Under `Debug > Debug Windows`, add an alphabetically-ordered entry **"Island Controller"** that opens a singleton `NSWindowController` containing:

- An "Enable island" toggle bound to the same `island.enabled` key (not a separate preference).
- A live table of the current `IslandSession` rows showing `workspaceId`, `panelId`, `agentKind`, `phase`, `rawStatusValue`, `unreadCount`, `lastActivity`.
- An "Inject test session" button that pushes a synthetic `IslandSession` through the store for visual iteration without needing a real agent running.

Per CLAUDE.md this is wrapped in `#if DEBUG` / `#endif`.

### 7.4 Discoverability

No first-run prompt, no in-app tip, no notification. Release notes and `CHANGELOG.md` announce the feature and instruct users to toggle it on.

## 8. Testing

Per CLAUDE.md "Test quality policy", tests exercise observable runtime behavior. Per "Testing policy", tests run in CI (`cmux-unit` scheme / `test-e2e.yml`), never locally.

### 8.1 Unit tests (`cmuxTests/Island/`)

1. **`IslandSessionPhaseTests`** — pure function tests over `IslandSessionPhase.from(rawValue:)`. Every synonym in §5.3 maps to the expected phase; unknown strings map to `.unknown`. Table-driven.

2. **`IslandStateStoreProjectionTests`** — store constructed with a fake `IslandStateSource` (a protocol wrapping the minimum `TabManager` surface the store reads). Assertions:
   - Workspace with no known-kind entries → zero sessions.
   - Workspace with `statusEntries["claude_code"] = Running` → exactly one session with the right fields.
   - Two known-kind entries on the same panel → highest-priority wins per §5.2.
   - `unreadCount` is read from the notification source, never guessed.
   - Clearing a status entry removes the corresponding session in the next emission.
   - Updating `panelTitle` rewrites the emitted session without changing `id`.

3. **`IslandSessionSortTests`** — ordering predicate. Asserts running → waiting → error → idle → unknown, tiebreak by `lastActivity` descending.

4. **`IslandVisibilityTests`** — given a `sessions: [IslandSession]` publisher stream, asserts the downstream `visible: Bool` stream matches §5.4.

5. **`IslandJumpRouterTests`** — router depends only on `IslandFocusSink`. Spy implementation records calls. Test verifies `jump(to: session)` produces the sequence `activate → selectWorkspace(id) → focusPanel(id) → collapse`. A test for the "workspace deleted" edge case verifies the router collapses without calling `activate`.

6. **`IslandConfigRoundTripTests`** — `island.enabled` written via `@AppStorage` round-trips through `CmuxConfig` → `settings.json` → `CmuxConfig`, so editing the file is equivalent to the Settings toggle.

### 8.2 Non-goals for automated tests

- Snapshot tests of `NotchShape`. Per CLAUDE.md these would be source-shape tests. Instead, the debug-window "Inject test session" path lets a reviewer verify the shape interactively during PR review.
- NSPanel lifecycle on full screen / space switches / multi-display. Too environment-dependent for unit tests. Covered by a manual PR smoke-test checklist (see §9).
- `IslandJumpRouter`'s downstream effect on `TabManager` — the existing `workspace.select` / `pane.focus` tests already exercise that code path; we don't duplicate.

### 8.3 Regression test commit policy

Per CLAUDE.md, bugs discovered during implementation that warrant a regression test follow the two-commit pattern: failing test first, fix second.

## 9. Manual PR smoke test checklist

The reviewer runs the following against a tagged `reload.sh --tag island-mvp` build:

1. Settings → Island → toggle on; no sessions yet → island should **not** appear.
2. In a cmux terminal, run `cmux set-status claude_code Running` → pill appears with green dot, count `1`.
3. Click the pill → expands; row shows the current workspace + panel, phase RUNNING, elapsed 0m counting up.
4. Click outside the panel → collapses.
5. In a second workspace, `cmux set-status codex Idle` → collapsed pill still visible, count `2`, dot still green (because Claude Code is still running).
6. `cmux set-status claude_code Error` → dot turns red.
7. Click the pill → expand → click the Claude Code row → cmux comes to front, the Claude Code workspace is selected, the panel is focused.
8. `cmux clear-status claude_code` on the first workspace → row disappears; count drops to `1`.
9. `cmux clear-status codex` on the second → row disappears; island orderOut's with no artifacts.
10. Switch to another Space, then to a full-screen app → island follows (`.canJoinAllSpaces`, `.fullScreenAuxiliary`).
11. Rapidly toggle Settings → Island off/on 10 times → no leftover panel, no orphaned observers (verified via Debug > Debug Windows > Island Controller live row count resetting correctly).
12. On a non-notch Mac: island renders as a floating pill at top-center; all other behavior identical.

| Explicit session CLI (`cmux session start`)     | Adds a third source to `IslandStateStore` alongside `statusEntries` and `notifications`. No UI changes.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Mark-read from island                           | Add `IslandActionSink` next to `IslandFocusSink`; route clicks on the unread badge to `TerminalNotificationStore.markRead(panelId:)`.                                                                                                                                             |
| Hover-to-expand                                 | One-line addition in `IslandRootView` (`.onHover { … }`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Auto-dismiss idle rows after N minutes          | Add an optional `idleTTL: TimeInterval` to `IslandStateStore` and drop expired rows during projection. Off by default.                                                                                                                                                            |
