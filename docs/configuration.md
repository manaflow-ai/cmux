# cmux.json settings

Global app preferences live in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json`.

## `app.confirmQuit`

Controls when cmux asks before quitting:

- `always`: show the quit confirmation on Cmd+Q or app quit.
- `dirty-only`: show it only when a workspace has a terminal or panel that reports close confirmation is needed.
- `never`: quit immediately.

Default: `always` for stable and nightly builds. DEV builds always behave as `never`, regardless of the file setting, so tagged development builds can be replaced without a full-screen quit dialog.

The older boolean `app.warnBeforeQuit` still works as a fallback when `app.confirmQuit` is not set. `true` maps to `always`; `false` maps to `never`.
