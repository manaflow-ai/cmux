# cmux.json settings

Global app preferences live in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json`.

## `app.windowTitleTemplate`

Opt-in template for the macOS `NSWindow.title`. Leave it unset or set it to an empty string to keep the default behavior, where the title follows the active workspace title or current directory.

```json
{
  "app": {
    "windowTitleTemplate": "[cmux:{windowToken}] {activeWorkspace}"
  }
}
```

Supported placeholders:

- `{windowId}`: the persisted per-window UUID.
- `{windowToken}`: the first 8 characters of the persisted window UUID.
- `{activeWorkspace}`: the active workspace title, falling back to the default title when the workspace title is blank.
- `{activeDirectory}`: the active workspace's current directory.
- `{defaultTitle}`: the title cmux would have used without a template.
- `{appName}`: `cmux`.

For tiling window managers such as AeroSpace or yabai, match on the stable token in the title. For example, the template above gives each restored macOS window a title containing `[cmux:abcd1234]`, so a rule can match `\\[cmux:abcd1234\\]`. The token is stable across relaunches for restored windows because it comes from the persisted window UUID.

## `app.confirmQuit`

Controls when cmux asks before quitting:

- `always`: show the quit confirmation on Cmd+Q or app quit.
- `dirty-only`: show it only when a workspace has a terminal or panel that reports close confirmation is needed.
- `never`: quit immediately.

Default: `always` for stable and nightly builds. DEV builds always behave as `never`, regardless of the file setting, so tagged development builds can be replaced without a full-screen quit dialog.

The older boolean `app.warnBeforeQuit` still works as a fallback when `app.confirmQuit` is not set. `true` maps to `always`; `false` maps to `never`.

## `app.forkConversationDefaultDestination`

Controls what the tab right-click `Fork Conversation` item does. The submenu still exposes every destination.

Values: `right`, `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `newTab`, `newWorkspace`.

Default: `right`.

## `terminal.agentHibernation`

Opt-in Agent Hibernation. cmux kills idle background agent processes to free RAM and CPU, then resumes each one with its saved session when you visit its tab. See [agent-hooks.md](agent-hooks.md#agent-hibernation) for the full behavior, including the confirmation settle window and how resume works.

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "agentHibernation": {
      "enabled": true,
      "idleSeconds": 5,
      "maxLiveTerminals": 12
    }
  }
}
```

- `enabled`: turn Agent Hibernation on. Default: `false`.
- `idleSeconds`: seconds a background idle agent terminal must be quiet before it can hibernate. A ~60s confirmation settle window still applies on top of this. Default: `5`. Range: `5`-`604800`.
- `maxLiveTerminals`: how many live restorable agent terminals to keep before cmux hibernates the oldest idle background ones. Nothing hibernates while you are at or under this count. Default: `12`. Range: `1`-`256`.

Enable it from the command palette (`⌘⇧P` -> Enable Agent Hibernation), from **Settings > Terminal > Agent Hibernation**, or with `cmux agent-hibernation on`.

## `sidebar.showAgentActivity`

Shows a loading spinner on sidebar workspace rows that currently have running coding agents or active manual loaders (`cmux workspace loading on`).

```json
{
  "sidebar": {
    "showAgentActivity": true,
    "loadingSpinnerPosition": "leading",
    "notificationBadgePosition": "leading"
  }
}
```

- `showAgentActivity`: show the spinner at all. Default: `true`. It is a live status signal, so it stays visible even when `sidebar.hideAllDetails` is on. Toggle it from **Settings > Sidebar > Show Loading Spinner**.
- `loadingSpinnerPosition`: `leading` (left, sharing the unread-badge slot) or `trailing` (right, in the close-button corner). Default: `leading`.
- `notificationBadgePosition`: which side the unread notification badge sits on, `leading` or `trailing`. Default: `leading`.

The spinner is compositor-driven (a Core Animation transform run by the render server), so it costs no per-frame CPU and pauses automatically while the window is occluded or Reduce Motion is on. Toggle it manually per workspace with `cmux workspace loading <on|off> [--id <name>]`; each `--id` is a separate loader and the command prints the workspace state as `before=ON;after=OFF`.

## `automation.workspaceAutoNaming`

Opt-in AI auto-naming of workspaces and tabs from agent conversation content. When enabled, cmux summarizes supported agent sessions into short sidebar and tab names using each agent's own binary, and refreshes them as the conversation topic shifts. See [workspace-auto-naming.md](workspace-auto-naming.md) for the supported adapter list and full behavior.

```json
{
  "automation": {
    "workspaceAutoNaming": true
  }
}
```

Default: `false`. Manual renames (sidebar, command palette, CLI, or `/rename`) always win: a workspace or tab you renamed yourself is never auto-named again until you clear its custom name. Enable it from **Settings > Automation > Workspace Auto-Naming**.

## `diffViewer.defaultLayout`

Controls the initial layout for newly opened diff viewers.

Values: `unified`, `split`.

Default: `unified`.

```json
{
  "diffViewer": {
    "defaultLayout": "unified"
  }
}
```

The toolbar layout toggle persists the last user choice for future generated diff viewers. Passing `cmux diff --layout split` or `cmux diff --layout unified` overrides both the saved toolbar choice and this default for that invocation.
