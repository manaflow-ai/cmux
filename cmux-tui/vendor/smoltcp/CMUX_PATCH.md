# cmux smoltcp patch

This directory vendors smoltcp 0.14.0 from crates.io. cmux-wg runs it as the
userspace TCP inside its WireGuard tunnels, with CUBIC.

Upstream CUBIC starts every connection at a 2 × 1024 byte congestion window. The
cmux patch starts it at RFC 6928's initial window, `min(10 * MSS, max(2 * MSS,
14600))` bytes: 10 KiB before the handshake, then 11,600 bytes once the tunnel's
1160 byte MSS is known. The window follows an MSS learned from the handshake
only until the first ACK of new data or the first loss. Linux and the other
common stacks have started at 10 segments since 2013. A 200 KB first message
needs about 4 round trips instead of about 7.

The window counts the segments the socket actually sends: on every SYN the
socket hands the controller `min(local, remote)` MSS, also when the peer sent no
MSS option (536 bytes). `Socket::reset()` starts the next connection on a fresh
controller of the same kind, so a reused socket gets the initial window again.
A listening socket that an RST sends from SYN-RECEIVED back to LISTEN drops
that peer's MSS and window the same way.

The changes are in `src/socket/tcp/congestion/cubic.rs` and `src/socket/tcp.rs`,
each marked `cmux patch`, with tests next to them. Reno's own start is unchanged;
cmux does not enable it.
Remove this vendor copy when the smoltcp version used by cmux starts at the
RFC 6928 window.
