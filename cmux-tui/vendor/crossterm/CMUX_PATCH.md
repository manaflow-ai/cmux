# cmux Crossterm patch

This directory vendors Crossterm 0.29.0. cmux enables Kitty keyboard protocol
flags 4 and 16, but upstream 0.29.0 discards the reported shifted key,
PC-101-layout key, and associated text while parsing CSI-u events.

The cmux patch adds `EnhancedKeyEvent`, preserves those fields in the Unix
parser, and keeps the original `KeyEvent` identity and modifiers intact. Remove
the patch when [crossterm-rs/crossterm#968](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/issues/968)
ships in the Crossterm version used by cmux.

## End of input on the controlling terminal

The Unix mio event source reads the terminal in a loop and only left that loop
for `WouldBlock` or `Interrupted`. A read that returned zero bytes, or any other
error such as the `EIO` a hung-up pty can report, fell through to the next
iteration. Once a terminal emulator exits without delivering `SIGHUP`, its
descriptor stays ready and every read reports end of input, so the loop never
exited: the client pinned one core and, with its input thread unable to return,
stopped responding to `SIGTERM`.

The cmux patch returns `UnexpectedEof` for a read of zero bytes and propagates
every other read error, so the caller learns the terminal is gone. Regression
coverage: `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-tui/tests/dead_tty_input.rs`. Remove this part
of the patch when the Crossterm version used by cmux reports end of input.
