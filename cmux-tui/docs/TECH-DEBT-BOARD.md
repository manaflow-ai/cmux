# cmux-tui technical-debt board

Audit base: `origin/main` at `17466308a52cb53e417e07085f108800efedd267`.
Audit wave: implementation wave 1. Source audit: 24 parallel inventory
sessions plus 12 implementation/review sessions in this run (36 productive
subagent sessions), and the nine recorded TUI sessions from rounds 1-9
(2026-08-19 through 2026-08-21) plus the cmux-devboxes checklist.

## Current state

The wave-1 integration branch is based on the audit SHA above. The exact
current tip is always available with `git rev-parse HEAD` in the worktree.
The shared primary checkout was dirty before this run, so all changes are in
isolated worktrees and no unrelated files were touched.

The branch contains a bounded remote lookup fix, runtime hardening with a
behavior test, a session snapshot boundary, relay invariant errors, a docs
cleanup, a CI toolchain fix, and this board. Rust verification remains
hosted-only under `AGENTS.md`.

The platform exposed 24 subagent slots, so this run used 36 substantive
subagent sessions in bounded waves. I did not create empty sessions to claim
the requested 10,000 count. Further waves must have a concrete code, test,
research, or merge-gate deliverable.

## Architecture decision

Use Ghostty manual-IO for daemon-backed surfaces. The app will own one direct
byte pump (daemon replay, live output, raw input, resize, and close status)
instead of spawning `cmux-tui attach` inside a nested PTY. Keep the daemon as
the durable owner of terminal and layout state. Migrate in this order:
`--pipe-io` proof, pump-owned resize/close, native `cmux.protocol/2` client,
then removal of the exec-attach bridge. This records the user request from
round 9B; no manual-IO proof exists yet.

## Completed request chains

| Request | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier-A daemon attach and quit/reopen survival | [PR 10408](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10408) | First pass complete. Known cuts: launchd supervision, first-tab/split coverage, cwd/env, orphan cleanup. |
| Journal topology survives terminal exit | [PR 10413](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10413) | Complete for exit preservation. Checkpoints and agent launch specs remain open. |
| Scoped attach mouse/cursor correctness | [PR 10428](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10428) | Complete through replay, reattach, and CI XCUITest. Focus forwarding and OSC 52 remain pre-existing gaps. |
| Checkpoint capture race | [PR 10501](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10501) | Complete for bounded, non-destructive capture. Journal growth/GC is still open. |
| Terminal close and liveness reporting | [PR 10513](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10513) | Complete for tested host loss and daemon loss paths. Exact round-7 trigger remains unproven. |
| Spec-only plan | [PR 10388](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10388) | Closed by direction. Specs must land with implementation. |

## Open requests and acceptance work

| Request | Acceptance gap | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual-IO transport | `--pipe-io` PoC must render live output, accept typing/mouse, replay on relaunch, and prove one reply authority. | Next implementation slice. |
| Daemon lifecycle | launchd user supervision and detached update handoff with host version compatibility. | Open. |
| Durable restore | Full journal restore, terminal checkpoints, reboot scrollback, agent `--resume` and hibernation. | Open or partial. |
| State ownership | Daemon window resources, dock/panel resource types, WebKit placeholders, typed frontend projections. | Open or partial. |
| Cloud TUI | Build/auth/create/resume/enroll/attach, machine rail, provider-neutral status, lifecycle operations, reconnect, packaging, version rollback, accessibility. | Checklist remains unchecked in `plans/cmux-devboxes.md` (not copied into this worktree). |
| Backpressure | Bound journal/WAL work and terminal-output admission so a multi-second stall cannot wedge btop. | Open blocker. |

## Change log and revert guidance

### Wave-1 commits

| Commit | Change | Proof / residual risk | Revert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `352c3a2ebb` | Index browser sources once per refreshed remote tree; preserve pre-refresh browser lookup. | `git diff --check`; hosted Rust test still required. | Revert this commit only; the old tree scan returns, with the prior scale cost. |
| `bedc018adb` | Add path context to Chrome profile setup errors and decode OS hostnames lossily. | Behavior test is in `ab674165c8`; hosted Rust test still required. | Revert both runtime commits together to restore the old error behavior. |
| `ab674165c8` | Add invalid-UTF-8 and empty-hostname behavior coverage. | Test is deterministic and platform-gated; hosted Rust test required. | Revert with `bedc018adb`. |
| `0e8a47209f` | Make `server start/status/stop/attach` canonical and remove obsolete browser/profile setup steps. | `git diff --check`; docs-only. | Revert this commit; no runtime state changes. |
| `aab58dd6d7` | Make CI read the pinned `rust-toolchain.toml` instead of workflow-specific Rust versions. | Workflow/static guard checks; hosted SDK and relay jobs required. | Revert this commit; CI returns to duplicated pins. |
| `16942a5d49` | Add a `SessionPort` snapshot boundary shared by local and remote sessions. | Behavior test compares the port with the existing topology read; hosted Rust test required. | Revert this commit; the frontend uses the direct enum again. |
| `e09f068dc4` | Convert relay slot/circuit invariant panics into atomic explicit errors. | `git diff --check`; hosted relay tests required. | Revert this commit; the old invariant panics return. |
| `eaa7108e9b` | Add this durable board and request log. | Markdown only. | Revert this commit; code remains unchanged. |

The integration branch can be reverted safely by reverting the rows in reverse
order. Do not revert the manual-IO bridge until its replacement has a hosted
red/green behavior proof.

- `PR 10408`: app bridge, quit policy, close semantics, config isolation, and
  TERM propagation. Revert its app commits together if removing the spike;
  keep daemon journal changes only with an explicit owner.
- `PR 10428`: replay mouse-wire-format and scoped attach fixes. Revert the
  serialization and client encoder as one unit; otherwise reattach can regress
  to urxvt encoding.
- `PR 10501`: checkpoint snapshot locking and quiet failure handling. Revert
  only with a replacement bounded-capture design; the old path disconnected
  healthy hosts.
- `PR 10513`: liveness sweep, reconnect give-up notices, and client exit
  reasons. Revert as one chain, then restore the prior exit-state contract.
- Manual-IO work: each slice must have a red behavior test before the fix and
  a hosted green run before removing bridge code. Revert by disabling the flag
  and retaining the existing bridge until the next slice is ready.

## Explicit blockers

1. No manual-IO implementation or end-to-end proof exists yet.
2. Journal size and WAL checkpoint latency can still create terminal-output
   admission stalls; prevention is not claimed.
3. launchd supervision, reboot checkpoints, and full agent restore are not
   implemented.
4. Cloud TUI acceptance remains a product-sized backlog, not a completed
   cmux-tui change.
