/// Regression coverage for
/// https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5830.
///
/// Control-socket command handlers that wait on an async callback (a
/// `browser eval`/`screenshot`/`cookies` WKWebView completion, etc.) bridge it
/// to a synchronous socket reply through `socketAwaitCallback`. That waiter
/// must never run on the **main thread**: historically it spun a nested
/// `CFRunLoopRun()` there, freezing the whole app (sidebar + every other CLI
/// client serialized behind it) for the full command timeout.
///
/// The control-command execution policy already routes every callback-waiting
/// command onto the socket-worker thread, so reaching the waiter on the main
/// thread is a programming error. The contract verified here: a main-thread
/// call returns `nil` immediately **without** kicking off the async work, so
/// the dispatcher surfaces a fast timeout instead of parking AppKit.
