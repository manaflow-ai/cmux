/// Serializes the phone→Mac natural-grid viewport reports and their
/// effective-grid echoes so they cannot race each other.
///
/// `GhosttySurfaceView` emits a natural-grid report whenever its viewport
/// changes (keyboard show/hide, rotation, zoom settle). Each report
/// round-trips to the Mac as an async RPC whose reply echoes the daemon's
/// effective grid. Firing one detached Task per report (the previous
/// coordinator shape) allowed two hazards:
///
/// 1. **Send scrambling** — Task scheduling order is unspecified, so the
///    keyboard-DOWN report could reach the daemon BEFORE the earlier
///    keyboard-UP report, leaving the shared PTY on the stale keyboard-up
///    grid.
/// 2. **Stale echo application** — replies resolve out of order, so the echo
///    of an old, smaller report could land last and re-pin the phone to a
///    grid it already outgrew. The natural grid is unchanged afterwards, so
///    nothing re-reports and the letterbox (empty space above the terminal)
///    is permanent.
///
/// The scheduler closes both: reports are sent strictly one at a time in
/// submission order, a newer submission supersedes an unsent older one (the
/// daemon only needs the newest), and an echo is applied only when its report
/// is still the newest one submitted.
