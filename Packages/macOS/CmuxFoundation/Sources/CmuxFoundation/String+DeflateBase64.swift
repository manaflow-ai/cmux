/// SSH terminal startup commands carry the remote bootstrap script (≈150 KB of
/// bundled shell integration) so the surface command can recreate it after a
/// reconnect or session restore. Inlining it as raw base64 pushes a single
/// `cmux ssh-pty-attach` invocation — and the `/bin/sh -c` wrapper that embeds
/// it, carried twice across the surface's `login`/`sh` layers — past a megabyte
/// of `argv`. That bloats `ps aux` output enough to break tools that scan the
/// process table with a bounded buffer (see manaflow-ai/cmux#6738).
///
/// `deflatedBase64` zlib-compresses the UTF-8 bytes (RFC 1950 zlib format,
/// via `NSData`'s `.zlib` algorithm) and base64-encodes the result; a real shell script
/// compresses 5–13×, so the inlined literal shrinks proportionally.
/// `init?(deflatedBase64:)` reverses it with a bounded zlib inflater. The format
/// never has to interoperate with command-line `gzip`.
