# Notifications

cmuxterm supports desktop notifications, allowing AI agents and scripts to alert you when they need attention.

## How It Works

1. A process in the terminal sends an OSC escape sequence
2. cmuxterm parses the notification title and body
3. If the terminal isn't focused, a desktop notification appears
4. The tab shows an unread badge

## Sending Notifications

### Using the CLI

The simplest way to send a notification:

```bash
cmuxterm notify --title "Task Complete" --body "Your build finished"
```

With a subtitle:

```bash
cmuxterm notify --title "Claude Code" --subtitle "Waiting" --body "Agent needs input"
```

### Using OSC Sequences

You can send notifications directly using escape sequences:

#### OSC 99 (Kitty Protocol)

```bash
# Basic notification
printf '\e]99;i=1;e=1;d=0:Hello World\e\\'

# With title and body
printf '\e]99;i=1;e=1;d=0;p=title:My Title\e\\'
printf '\e]99;i=1;e=1;d=0;p=body:Message body here\e\\'
```

#### OSC 777 (RXVT Protocol)

```bash
printf '\e]777;notify;My Title;Message body here\a'
```

See [OSC Sequences](/docs/osc-sequences) for full format documentation.

## Notification Behavior

### Suppression

Notifications are suppressed (no desktop alert) when:

- The cmuxterm window is focused
- The specific tab sending the notification is active
- The notification panel is open

This prevents duplicate alerts when you're already looking at the terminal.

### Notification Panel

Press **⌘⇧I** to open the notification panel, showing all notifications:

- Click a notification to jump to that tab
- Notifications are marked as read when viewed
- Clear all with the clear button

### Quick Jump

Press **⌘⇧U** to jump directly to the tab with the most recent unread notification.

## Notification Lifecycle

1. **Received** - Notification appears in panel, desktop alert fires (if not suppressed)
2. **Unread** - Badge shown on tab
3. **Read** - Cleared when you view that tab
4. **Cleared** - Removed from panel

## Integration Examples

### Notify After Long Command

```bash
# Add to your shell config
notify-after() {
  "$@"
  local exit_code=$?
  if [ $exit_code -eq 0 ]; then
    cmuxterm notify --title "✓ Command Complete" --body "$1"
  else
    cmuxterm notify --title "✗ Command Failed" --body "$1 (exit $exit_code)"
  fi
  return $exit_code
}

# Usage
notify-after npm run build
```

### Notify When Build Finishes

```bash
npm run build && cmuxterm notify --title "Build Success" --body "Ready to deploy"
```

### Watch Script Completion

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# long-running-task.sh

do_work() {
  # ... your task
  sleep 10
}

do_work
cmuxterm notify --title "Task Complete" --body "long-running-task.sh finished"
```
