# Vertical Tabs

cmuxterm displays all your workspaces as vertical tabs in a sidebar on the left side of the window, making it easy to see and switch between them at a glance. Each sidebar tab is a [workspace](/concepts) that can contain multiple split panes and surfaces.

## Sidebar Features

- **Always visible** - All workspaces shown at once, no hidden tabs
- **Resizable** - Drag the sidebar edge to resize (140-360pt)
- **Current directory** - Each workspace shows its working directory
- **Notification badges** - Unread notification indicators
- **Keyboard navigation** - Quick switching without mouse

## Tab Operations

### Create

- **⌘N** - New workspace
- **⌘T** - New surface (tab within the current pane)

### Close

- **⌘⇧W** - Close the current workspace
- **⌘W** - Close the current surface (closes workspace if it's the last one)

### Switch Workspaces

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘1** - **⌘9** | Jump to workspace 1-9 |
| **⌘⇧]** | Next workspace |
| **⌘⇧[** | Previous workspace |

### Jump to Notifications

- **⌘⇧U** - Jump to the workspace with the latest unread notification
- **⌘⇧I** - Show the notifications panel

## Workspace Titles

Workspace titles are determined by:

1. **Terminal title** - Set via OSC escape sequence
2. **Current directory** - Shown if no title is set
3. **Workspace number** - Fallback display

You can set a custom title from within the terminal:

```bash
# Set workspace title
echo -e "\033]0;My Custom Title\007"

# Or using printf
printf "\033]0;Build Server\007"
```

## Toggle Sidebar

- **⌘B** - Toggle the sidebar visibility

When the sidebar is hidden, you can still use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between tabs.

## Sidebar Indicators

Workspaces display visual indicators:

- **Blue dot** - Unread notification in this workspace
- **Bold title** - Currently selected workspace
- **Directory path** - Current working directory
