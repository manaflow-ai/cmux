# cmuxterm

cmuxterm is a lightweight, native macOS terminal built on Ghostty for managing multiple AI coding agents. It features vertical tabs, a notification panel, and a socket-based control API.

## Why cmuxterm?

- **Native macOS app** - Built with Swift and AppKit, not Electron. Fast startup, low memory usage, and native look and feel.
- **Lightweight** - Small binary, minimal resource footprint. No bundled browser engine.
- **GPU-accelerated** - Powered by libghostty for buttery smooth rendering.

When running AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or similar tools, you need to:

- **Manage multiple terminal sessions** - Each agent runs in its own terminal
- **Know when agents need attention** - Agents waiting for input should notify you
- **Automate terminal control** - Programmatically create tabs, send input, and more

cmuxterm solves these with:

- **Vertical sidebar tabs** - All terminals visible at a glance
- **OSC 99/777 notifications** - Desktop alerts when agents need you
- **Unix socket API** - Full programmatic control for automation

## Quick Start

```bash
brew tap manaflow-ai/cmuxterm
brew install --cask cmuxterm
```

Or [download the DMG](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmuxterm/releases/latest/download/cmuxterm-macos.dmg) directly.
