# Installation

## Homebrew (Recommended)

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap manaflow-ai/cmuxterm
brew install --cask cmuxterm
```

To update later:

```bash
brew upgrade --cask cmuxterm
```

## Manual Download

Download the latest release from GitHub:

<a href="https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmuxterm/releases/latest/download/cmuxterm-macos.dmg">
  <img src="/macos-badge.png" alt="Download cmuxterm for macOS" width="180" />
</a>

Then:

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
2. Drag **cmuxterm** to your **Applications** folder
3. Open cmuxterm from Applications

<Callout type="info">
  On first launch, macOS may ask you to confirm opening an app from an identified developer. Click **Open** to proceed.
</Callout>

## Verify Installation

Open cmuxterm and you should see:

- A terminal window with a vertical tab sidebar on the left
- One initial tab already open
- The Ghostty-powered terminal ready for input

## CLI Tool

cmuxterm includes a command-line tool for automation. It's bundled inside the app and works automatically when you run commands inside cmuxterm.

To use the CLI from outside cmuxterm, you can create a symlink:

```bash
sudo ln -sf "/Applications/cmuxterm.app/Contents/MacOS/cmuxterm" /usr/local/bin/cmuxterm
```

Then you can run commands like:

```bash
cmuxterm list-tabs
cmuxterm notify --title "Build Complete" --body "Your build finished successfully"
```

## Updates

cmuxterm checks for updates automatically using Sparkle. When an update is available, you'll see an update pill in the titlebar. Click it to install the latest version.

You can also check for updates manually via **cmuxterm → Check for Updates** in the menu bar.
