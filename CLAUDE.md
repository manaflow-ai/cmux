This project is called cmux. cmux is a web app that spawns Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Amp, Opencode, Kimi CLI, and other coding agent CLIs in parallel across multiple tasks. For each run, cmux spawns an isolated openvscode instance via Docker or a configurable sandbox provider. The openvscode instance by default opens the git diff UI and a terminal with the running dev server (configurable via devcontainer.json).

# Config

Use bun to install dependencies and run the project.
`./scripts/dev.sh` will start the project. Optional flags:

- `--force-docker-build`: Rebuild worker image even if cached.
- `--show-compose-logs`: Also stream Docker Compose logs to the console (they are always written to `logs/docker-compose.log`). Docker build logs are always shown.

After finishing a task, run `bun run check` in root to typecheck and lint everything. You should always cd to root and run this command; do not manually run tsc or eslint any other way.

# Backend

This project uses Convex and Hono.
Hono is defined in apps/www/lib/hono-app.ts as well as apps/www/lib/routes/\*
The Hono app generates a client in @cmux/www-openapi-client. This is automatically re-generated when the dev-server is running. If you change the Hono app (and the dev server isn't running), you should run `(cd apps/www && bun run generate-openapi-client)` to re-generate the client. Note that the generator is in www and not www-openapi-client.
We MUST force validation of requests that do not have the proper `Content-Type`. Set the value of `request.body.required` to `true`. For example:

```ts
app.openapi(
  createRoute({
    method: "post",
    path: "/books",
    request: {
      body: {
        content: {
          "application/json": {
            schema: z.object({
              title: z.string(),
            }),
          },
        },
        required: true, // <== add
      },
    },
    responses: {
      200: {
        description: "Success message",
      },
    },
  }),
  (c) => c.json(c.req.valid("json"))
);
```

## Convex

Schemas are defined in packages/convex/convex/schema.ts.
If you're working in Convex dir, you cannot use node APIs/import from "node:*"
Use crypto.subtle instead of node:crypto
Exception is if the file defines only actions and includes a "use node" directive at the top of the file

# Frontend

This project uses React, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.
Always use tailwind `neutral` instead of `gray` for gray colors.
Always support dark mode.

# Misc

Always use "node:" prefixes for node imports
Do not use the "any" type
Do not use casts unless absolutely necessary (eg. it's better )
Don't modify README.md unless explicitly asked
Do not write docs unless explicitly asked
Do not use dynamic imports unless absolutely necessary. Exceptions include when you're following existing patterns in the codebase
We're using Node 24, which supports global fetch

# Tests

Use vitest
Place test files next to the file they test using a .test.ts extension
Do not use mocks
Do not do early returns (eg. skipping tests if we're missing environment variables)
Make tests resilient

## Logs

When running `./scripts/dev.sh`, service logs are written to `logs/{type}.log`:

- docker-compose.log: Output from `.devcontainer` Docker Compose stack. Hidden from console by default; use `--show-compose-logs` to stream.
- convex-dev.log: Convex development server (`bunx convex dev`).
- server.log: Backend dev server in `apps/server`.
- client.log: Frontend dev server in `apps/client` (Vite).

Log files are overwritten on each run. Use `tail -f logs/<file>` to follow live output.
