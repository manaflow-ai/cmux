## Features

- **Vertical tabs** — See all your terminals at a glance in a sidebar
- **Notification panel** — Tabs flash when AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) need your attention
- **Built on libghostty** — Native macOS performance with Ghostty's GPU-accelerated rendering
- **Auto-updates** — Stay current with Sparkle-powered updates

## Why cmuxterm?

Running multiple AI coding agents? cmuxterm helps you manage them. Instead of losing track of which terminal needs input, the notification panel shows you exactly where to look.
