## Features

- **Native macOS app** — Built with Swift and AppKit, not Electron. Fast startup, low memory.
- **Vertical tabs** — See all your terminals at a glance in a sidebar
- **Notification panel** — Tabs flash when AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) need your attention
- **Lightweight** — Small binary, minimal resource footprint. No bundled browser engine.
- **GPU-accelerated** — Powered by libghostty for smooth rendering

## Install

**Homebrew:**

```bash
brew tap manaflow-ai/cmuxterm
brew install --cask cmuxterm
```

Or [download the DMG](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmuxterm/releases/latest/download/cmuxterm-macos.dmg) directly.

## Why cmuxterm?

Running multiple AI coding agents? cmuxterm helps you manage them. Instead of losing track of which terminal needs input, the notification panel shows you exactly where to look.

A native macOS app means it launches instantly, uses minimal RAM, and feels right at home on your Mac.
