# optchat-chief

An OptChat Chief for cmux-next Home. It keeps the brain-host contract of
`mux/host` (so the app needs no changes) and replaces the long-lived `mux`
acpmux session with the turn loop of Victor Taelin's OptChat spec: every human
message is logged into one endless OptChat memory, and every turn is a fresh
model call that reads the memory's view (about 128 KB of one-line summaries of
the whole chat) plus the new messages. The compactor that builds the summaries
runs inside the host on the team subrouter.

Two engines run a turn (`OPTCHAT_CHIEF_ENGINE`):

- `native` (default): the host's own Messages API loop with `bash`, the text
  editor, `zoom` and `date`. It is the engine that keeps sections 7 and 8
  whole: three cache breakpoints in the view plus the request end, model
  output resent verbatim, tool results capped at CAP, and messages sent
  during a turn delivered between tool calls (as MASTER says).
- `acpmux`: a fresh acpmux session per turn (`MUX_HARNESS`, default
  claude-sr). Claude Code's own breakpoints never land in the view, so each
  turn rewrites the view in the cache, and claude-sr takes no message
  mid-run: a human message stops the running turn (`session/cancel`) and
  the next fresh turn answers with the view of everything the stopped turn
  did. Claude Code's Task/Agent subagents are denied (their steps would be
  logged as the Chief's); `chief agents` starts agents instead.

## Run it with a tagged cmux-next build

1. Build the binary on the build host (cargo never runs on the laptop):

   ```bash
   nx-remote --worktree "$PWD" --cwd experiments/chief-optmem/optchat-chief \
     --fetch experiments/chief-optmem/optchat-chief/target/release/optchat-chief \
     -- bash -c "umask 022; OPTCHAT_BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) cargo build --release"
   ```

   Copy the fetched file to `experiments/chief-optmem/optchat-chief/dist/optchat-chief` (gitignored).
   Build with `OPTCHAT_BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)` in the
   command's environment: the host's first log line names the build, so a
   dogfood run shows which code it runs. Rebuild before every dogfood run.

2. Start the tagged app with `CMUX_NEXT_MUX_HOST` naming that file, in the
   app's own environment (launch its executable from a shell with the
   variable set, or `launchctl setenv CMUX_NEXT_MUX_HOST /abs/path/optchat-chief`
   before `open`). The app starts the host when Home first opens, as
   `optchat-chief host --daemon-socket <daemon socket> --mux-home ~/.cmux/mux/tags/<tag>`,
   with `MUX_AGENT_TOKEN_FILE`, `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`, `ACPMUX_*`, `MUX_HARNESS`
   and `CMUX_MCP_COMMAND` set. Its stderr goes to `$MUX_HOME/host.log`.

3. Open Home and write in the Chief conversation. The reply shows as the
   `mux` participant (the conversation is the same one mux/host creates).

Only one brain host runs per `MUX_HOME`: this host takes the same kernel lock
as `mux/host` and the P1 Rust Chief (`$MUX_HOME/state/host.lock`), so a second
launch exits 0. Stop a running `mux/host` for that home first.

## Commands

```
optchat-chief host --daemon-socket PATH [--mux-home DIR]   the brain host (one per MUX_HOME)
optchat-chief mcp [--socket PATH | --mux-home DIR]           stdio MCP server: zoom, date
optchat-chief agents spawn --name N --cwd DIR [--harness H] [--policy P] "task"
optchat-chief agents list | prompt NAME "text" | allow NAME [OPTION_ID] | deny NAME
optchat-chief browse [--mux-home DIR] [--out FILE]          the whole memory as one HTML page
optchat-chief import [--mux-home DIR] FILE                  JSON lines {"text", "kind"?}, default note (host stopped)
```

Inside a turn the Chief runs `chief agents ...` (a launcher in
`$MUX_HOME/optchat/bin`, first on the turn's PATH). A child's final reply of
each turn comes back as one message `[<name>] <report>`, which starts a new
turn when the Chief is idle.

## Files

```
$MUX_HOME/state/host.lock         kernel lock shared with mux/host ("<pid>\n<start ms>\nflock\n")
$MUX_HOME/optchat/chat/           the OptChat memory: main/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl, tree/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl, lock;
                                  a git repository, committed after every turn (section 10)
$MUX_HOME/optchat/AGENTS.md       the user's own instructions, the end of the system prompt (read at host start)
$MUX_HOME/optchat/memory.html     `optchat-chief browse` output
$MUX_HOME/optchat/host.json       outbox, logged seq, pending turn, children
$MUX_HOME/optchat/tools.sock      the live memory for `optchat-chief mcp`
$MUX_HOME/optchat/session/        every turn's cwd: CLAUDE.md, .mcp.json, .claude/settings*.json
$MUX_HOME/optchat/bin/chief       launcher for `chief agents ...`
$MUX_HOME/optchat/claude/         the turn sessions' CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (settings.json: no auto-memory, no hooks)
```

`$MUX_HOME/optchat/` is mode 0700 and the log, tree and host.json are 0600:
the memory keeps everything the user pasted.

The system prompt (and the acpmux session's `CLAUDE.md`) is the spec's MASTER
and VIEW_DOC (agent renamed "Chief"), a short cmux section, then
`$MUX_HOME/optchat/AGENTS.md` when it exists. The files
this host writes (CLAUDE.md, the MCP tool list, the settings) are
byte-identical across turns. The request the model gets is not fully ours:

- Turn sessions start through an acpmux preset (`optchat-chief-<home id>`,
  saved in acpmux's config) whose env sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to
  `optchat/claude` and turns auto-memory off, so the user's
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, settings, hooks and project memory never reach a
  turn and MASTER's "instructions at the end of this prompt" holds. Unverified
  end to end: that `claude-sr` signs in with an empty config directory.
- Claude Code's own system prompt still comes first, with its date and
  environment lines, so the cached prefix changes at least once a day.
  Machine-wide managed settings still apply.

## Deviations from the spec

- **acpmux engine only: cache breakpoints in the view (section 8).** acpmux's
  Claude Code path forwards text blocks without `cache_control`, so a turn
  rewrites the view in the cache. The native engine places them. Each turn
  logs `turn <key> cache: first request read .. written .. uncached ..` to
  host.log either way; the first request's numbers show what crossed turns.
- **acpmux engine only: messages during a turn (section 7).** A human
  message stops the running turn and starts a fresh one, instead of reaching
  it between tool calls. Children's reports wait for the next turn. The
  brain-host contract has no user cancel, so neither engine can cancel a
  turn or the compactor wait on request; a turn past its limit is stopped.
- **Native engine: the bash tool.** Each command is its own `bash -c` (so a
  timeout kills all it started); the working directory carries over between
  commands, shell variables and exports do not. Tools are approve-all, like
  the acpmux engine's default policy; the text editor is not confined to a
  root. No MCP servers: the `cmux` CLI and `chief agents` run from bash.
- **Native engine: refusals.** A refused turn says so. Server-side
  `fallbacks: "default"` is off by default (`OPTCHAT_CHIEF_SERVER_FALLBACK`):
  the team subrouter may not forward its beta header.
- **Compactor refusals (section 4.1).** A node the compactor model declines
  is built by `claude-sonnet-5` (fewer safeguard categories) instead of
  being retried forever. Other failures retry every 10 s forever, as the spec
  says; after a minute of waiting the conversation hears which line fails.
- **Subagents (section 9).** Children get no view and no subagent system
  prompt; each reports alone, one `[name] reply` per ended turn; `prompt` is a
  queued new turn, not a delivery between tool calls; only the Chief
  conversation is read. With the native engine, children's reports are
  delivered between the Chief's tool calls like human messages.
- **What the user sees (section 7, "show it").** Home gets each turn's last
  reply only; earlier replies and tool steps are in the memory (and in
  `browse`), not posted.
- **Reply keys.** `turn:optchat:<first id>:<its stamp>`: the stamp keeps keys
  unique after a memory reset or a restored backup.

## Tests

```bash
nx-remote --worktree "$PWD" --cwd experiments/chief-optmem/optchat-chief \
  -- bash -c 'umask 022; cargo test --release; cargo clippy --release --all-targets -- -D warnings'
```

`tests/brain.rs` runs the brain against in-process fakes of both owners;
`tests/acpmux_wire.rs` and `tests/daemon_wire.rs` run the real clients against
fake servers on Unix sockets; `tests/lock.rs` runs the binary against a held
lock; `tests/mcp.rs` runs `optchat-chief mcp` against a live test memory.
